Question 1:
"If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?"

You can discuss the audio aura in terms of the calculated average energy, valence, and danceability of the listener's top 100 songs. For example:

"The audio aura of the listener could be characterized by the average energy, valence, and danceability of their top 100 songs. These metrics provide insights into the overall mood, positivity, and dance-friendly nature of the listener's music taste."

Question 2:
"Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?"

You can discuss potential limitations of the current approach and suggest improvements:

"The current calculation of the audio aura might not be fully representative as it relies solely on the average metrics, potentially overlooking nuances in the listener's preferences. A more representative approach could involve considering the distribution of these metrics, identifying clusters of songs with similar characteristics, or incorporating additional factors such as genre, tempo variation, or listening frequency."
